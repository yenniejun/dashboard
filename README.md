# Dashboard
## "Heartbeat of the city"
In this demo, I [311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) from the NYC Open Data Portal. I show overall noise complaints, noise complaints divided by boroguh, and divided by categories.

This is just a preliminary dashboard. Eventually, I would like to take other data points from 311 and from the NYC Open Data Portal (i.e. health, education, employment) and show the "heartbeat of a city"
